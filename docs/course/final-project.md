# Final Project

The final project is your opportunity to showcase everything you've learned in the course.

!!! info "Work in Progress"
    Detailed project specifications will be released mid-semester.

## Project Overview

The final project requires you to design and implement a complete robotic solution that integrates:

- Autonomous navigation (SLAM + Nav2)
- Sensor processing (camera, lidar, IMU)
- ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services)
- Gazebo simulation
- Documentation and presentation

## Requirements (Preliminary)

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Custom ROS 2 package with proper structure
- [ ] Autonomous robot navigation in simulated environment
- [ ] Sensor data processing and visualization
- [ ] Integration with SLAM and Nav2 stacks
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Clean, well-commented code

### Documentation

- [ ] Project README with usage instructions
- [ ] Architecture diagram showing nodes and topics
- [ ] Video demonstration of the robot in action
- [ ] Reflection on challenges and lessons learned

### Presentation

- [ ] 10-15 minute presentation
- [ ] Live demo in simulation
- [ ] Q&A session with professors

## Timeline (Provisional)

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Week 8 | Project brief and requirements finalized |
| Week 10 | Proposal due (problem statement + approach) |
| Week 13 | Mid-project check-in |
| Week 15 | Final submission |
| Week 16 | Presentations |

## Evaluation Rubric

Your project will be evaluated on:

- **Functionality** (35%) - Does it work as intended?
- **Code Quality** (25%) - Is it well-written and maintainable?
- **Documentation** (20%) - Is it clear and complete?
- **Innovation** (10%) - Did you go beyond the basics?
- **Presentation** (10%) - Can you explain what you built?

## Project Ideas

- Autonomous delivery robot that navigates a warehouse
- Search and rescue robot that explores an unknown environment
- Museum guide robot that provides interactive tours
- Collaborative multi-robot system
- Custom sensor integration (e.g., thermal camera, LiDAR)
- Real-world problem solving (traffic monitoring, inspections, etc.)

## Important: Academic Integrity

All project code must be your own work. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for:
